Model probing callback of embedding estimators
==============================================

This notebook will show you how to investigate the **data representation given
by an embedding estimator during training**  (such as SimCLR, y-Aware
Contrastive Learning or Barlow Twins) using the notion of "probing".
A standard machine learning model (e.g. linear or SVM) is trained and evaluated
on the data embedding for a given task as the model is being fitted. It allows
the user to understand what concepts are learned by the model.

This has been first introduced by Guillaume Alain and Yoshua Bengio in 2017
[1]_ to understand the internal behavior of a deep neural network along
the different layers. This technique aimed at answering questions like: what is
the intermediate representation of a neural network? What information is
contained for a given layer ?

Then, it has been adapted to benchmark self-supervised vision models
(like SimCLR, Barlow Twins, DINO, DINOv2) on classical datasets (ImageNet,
CIFAR, ...) by implementing linear probing and K-Nearest Neighbors probing
on model's output representation.

Unsupervised Contrastive Learning on MNIST
------------------------------------------

For illustration purposes on how to use the probing callback, we will focus
on the handwritten digits dataset MNIST. It contains 60k training images and
10k test images of size 28x28 pixels. Each image contains a digit from 0 to
9. It is rather small-scale compared to modern datasets like ImageNet but
sufficient to illustrate the probing technique.
We will train a SimCLR model on these data and probe the learned
representation using a logistic regression classifier on the digit
classification task. It will show how the data embedding evolves during
training to become more linearly separable for each digit class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-87

We start by loading the MNIST dataset dataset with standard scaling
transforms. These datasets are used for training and testing the probing.

Dataset and data augmentations for contrastive learning
-------------------------------------------------------

To perform contrastive learning, we need to define a set of data
augmentations to create multiple views of the same image. Since we work
with grayscale images, we will use random resized crop and Gaussian blur. We
reduce the size of the Gaussian kernel to 3x3 since MNIST images are only
28x28 pixels.

    contrast_transforms = transforms.Compose(
        [
            transforms.RandomResizedCrop(size=28, scale=(0.8, 1.0)),

            transforms.ToTensor(),

SimCLR training with classification probing callback
----------------------------------------------------

We can now create the probing callback that will train a logistic regression
classifier on the learned representation during SimCLR training. The probing
is performed every 2 epochs on the training and test sets. The classification
metrics (accuracy and f1-weighted) are logged to TensorBoard by default.

Since MNIST images are small, we can use a simple LeNet-like architecture
as encoder for SimCLR, with few parameters. The output dimension of the
encoder is set to 32, which is approximately 30 times smaller that the input,
but larger than the number of input classes (10).

We limit the training to 10 epochs for the sake of time and because it is

Visualization of the classification metrics during training
-----------------------------------------------------------

After training, we can visualize the classification metrics logged
by the linear probe using TensorBoard. The logged metrics are stored
in the `lightning_logs` folder by default. They contain the accuracy,
and f1-weighted scores.

**Observations**: we can see that the classification metrics increase
steadily during training, showing that the learned representation becomes
more and more linearly separable for the digit classes. The accuracy
reaches more than 80% after 10 epochs, which is quite good for such a simple
model trained *without supervision* and a small number of epochs.

Probing of y-Aware representation on age and sex prediction
-----------------------------------------------------------

We have previously seen a simple case where only one classification task is
being monitored during training. We can also monitor a mixed of classification
and regression tasks at the same time during training of an embedding model.
This could be useful if several target variables should be monitored from the
representation.
We will show how to perform this with nidl using the **ModelProbing**
callback on the OpenBHB dataset to monitor age and sex decoding from brain
imaging data. *We refer to the example on OpenBHB for more details on this
neuroimaging dataset.*

OpenBHB dataset and data augmentations
--------------------------------------

We consider the gray matter and CSF volumes on some **regions of
interests** in the Neuromorphometrics atlas across subjects in
OpenBHB ("vbm_roi" modality). These data are tabular (not images) but
they are still well suited for contrastive learning and they are very light
compared to the raw images (284-d vector for each subject).
We start by loading these data for training and testing the probing callback.
The target variables are age (regression) and sex (classification).

noise as data augmentations. These are well suited for tabular data.

y-Aware CL training with multitask probing callback
---------------------------------------------------

Next, we create the multitask probing callback that will train a ridge
regression on age and a logistic regression classifier on sex. The probing
is performed every epoch on the training and test sets. The metrics are
logged to TensorBoard by default.

To do so, we need to create a meta-estimator (compatible with scikit-learn)
that wraps the two estimators (ridge and logistic regression) and handles
the mixed regression/classification tasks. We provide such a meta-estimator
called **MultiTaskEstimator** below.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 460-499

.. code-block:: Python



    class MultiTaskEstimator(sk_BaseEstimator):
        """

        def __init__(self, estimators):
            self.estimators = estimators

        def fit(self, X, y):

        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.estimators)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 500-501

Then, we define a scorer specific for each task:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 501-513

.. code-block:: Python

    def make_task_scorer(metric_fn, task_index, **kwargs):
        """Returns a scorer evaluating on y or y[:, task_index]."""

                return metric_fn(y_true, y_pred)
            else:
                return metric_fn(y_true[:, task_index], y_pred[:, task_index])

        return make_scorer(scorer, **kwargs)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 514-516

Finally, we create the multitask probing callback with the relevant
estimators and scorers for age and sex.

y-Aware Contrastive Learning. The input dimension is 284 and we compress the

We can now create the y-Aware Contrastive Learning model with the MLP encoder

Visualization of the classification and regression metrics during training
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After training, we can visualize the classification and regression metrics
logged by the model probing using TensorBoard. The logged metrics are
stored in the `lightning_logs` folder by default.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 566-580

.. code-block:: Python


    log_dir = f"lightning_logs/version_{get_last_log_version()}/"

    # Reload the log file
    ea = event_accumulator.EventAccumulator(log_dir)

    metrics = [
        "test_age/r2",

Once all the metrics are loaded, we plot them as the number of training steps
increases. We create two subplots, one for each task (age regression and sex
classification).

Conclusions
-----------

In this notebook, we have shown how to use the model probing callbacks
available in nidl to monitor the evolution of the data representation
during training of embedding models such as SimCLR and y-Aware Contrastive
Learning. We have seen how to use the `ModelProbing` callback for
**single-task probing** and **multi-task probing**.
These callbacks allow to train standard machine learning models (e.g.
logistic regression, ridge regression, SVM) on the learned representation
at regular intervals during training and log the relevant metrics to
TensorBoard. This provides insights on what concepts are being learned by
the model and how the representation evolves to become more suitable for
downstream tasks.
